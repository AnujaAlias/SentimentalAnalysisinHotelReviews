since both st regis and four seasons where over  a night i decided to book the grand hyatt i wish i didn’t try to save money what a mistake  upon arrival the staff was very helpful and i checked into room     the  room itself was very dated and on the dirty side carpet in the room was extremely stained lamp shades full of dust spider webs and even some mold in the area where tea kettle was   upon leaving the hotel in the afternoon i asked them to do an extra cleaning round   when coming back at  hours regrettably no extra cleaning was performed and when opening the bed i unfortunately found a blood stain upon further review there was a large blood stain on the mattress protector surrounded by sperm marks i decided to call housekeeping but unfortunately i was unable to reach them after talking to the reception they would send “the housekeeping manager up” the gentleman who showed up was not housekeeping manager but most helpful after changing the sheets and mattress protector the housekeeping manager showed up i did show him some of the dirty spots and he would do “an extra thorough cleaning in the morning”   after an okay night sleep i went for breakfast next morning  there was nobody to welcome but found my way to a table the whole area was buzzing with staff so i ordered some pancakes from the made to order menu after  minutes no pancakes so i decided to ask a staff member a status update after  more minutes still no pancakes eventually i went to the pastry station and saw a desperate staff member throwing away a badge of ment to be pancakes it was one multiple wasted badges he apologized to me felt very guilty but was not able to create pancakes no joke regrettably non of the other  staff members standing around doing nothing really cared about the poor kid  upon returning to the hotel housekeeping had definitely cleaned the room but still missed all the spots i pointed out possibly these item where too old to clean but especially the lampshades where unacceptably dirty   to be honest after such a large incident you kind of expect an apology letter or a small cake non of it all during checkout if wasn’t even mentioned a true joke  this must have been the first time i was truly mislead by tripadvisor upon further review i saw a lot of  star reviews from first timers and local indians   this is an average  star hotel with an old interior the good on day  there was somebody who did bake pancakes and they where great and the shower had excellent power…read more,0.12,0.098,0.782
