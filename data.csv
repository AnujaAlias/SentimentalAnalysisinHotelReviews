"We 3 of family went for overnight staycation at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and thoroughly enjoyed their hospitality as well as luxurious rooms with very efficient room service as well as other high class amenities viz. Sauna, gym, fine dine restaurants, etc.  And we had amazing food & breakfast at their very famous restaurant 55East. The staff led by their over efficient captain Mr. Noheed Shaikh the head chef Mr. Sandeep Malsure, chef Sameer other server Mr. Dhruvit & to say all their staff very courteous, helpful and go out of their way to satisfy all your wants. Definitely I'm coming back soon for another staycation at this lovely 5 star hotel.

"Amazing service, big rooms and a great breakfast.   Loved my experience at the grand hyatt! It has to be one of the best services I've experienced in a hotel.  Ruby was really helpful with checking in and any enquiries about the room. Sanket & Sarswati at breakfast were really attentive. Manoj from house keeping was great as sorting out anything we needed from an iron to giving us laundry detergent.   We stayed in an 2 bedroom standard apartment - the room was a bit old however it is absolutely massive, really great for families. Read more"

"Since both St regis and four seasons where over $400 a night i decided to book the Grand Hyatt. I wish I didn’t try to save money, what a mistake.  Upon arrival the staff was very helpful and i checked into room 3160.    The  room itself was very dated and on the dirty side. Carpet in the room was extremely stained, lamp shades full of dust, spider webs and even some mold in the area where tea kettle was.   Upon leaving the hotel in the afternoon i asked them to do an extra cleaning round.   When coming back at 23 hours regrettably no extra cleaning was performed and when opening the bed i unfortunately found a blood stain. Upon further review there was a large blood stain on the mattress protector, surrounded by sperm marks. I decided to call housekeeping but unfortunately i was unable to reach them. After talking to the reception they would send “the housekeeping manager up” the gentleman who showed up was not housekeeping manager but most helpful. After changing the sheets and mattress protector, the housekeeping manager showed up. I did show him some of the dirty spots and he would do “an extra thorough cleaning in the morning” .  After an okay night sleep i went for breakfast next morning.  There was nobody to welcome but found my way to a table. The whole area was buzzing with staff, so i ordered some pancakes from the made to order menu. After 20 minutes no pancakes, so i decided to ask a staff member a status update. After 10 more minutes still no pancakes. Eventually i went to the pastry station and saw a desperate staff member throwing away a badge of ment to be pancakes. It was one multiple wasted badges. He apologized to me, felt very guilty but was not able to create pancakes (no Joke) regrettably non of the other 15 staff members standing around doing nothing really cared about the poor kid.  Upon returning to the hotel, housekeeping had definitely cleaned the room but still missed all the spots i pointed out. Possibly these item where too old to clean but especially the lampshades where unacceptably dirty.   To be honest after such a large incident you kind of expect an apology letter or a small cake non of it all, during checkout if wasn’t even mentioned. A true Joke  This must have been the first time i was truly mislead by tripadvisor. Upon further review i saw a lot of 5 star reviews from First timers and local Indians.   This is an average 3-4 star hotel with an old interior .The good: on day 2 there was somebody who did bake pancakes and they where great, and the shower had excellent power.…Read more"

"This review is based on my most recent stay at this property this month, but some of the comments are applicable to previous visits as well.   The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is a large hotel with many rooms, suites and residences (apartments), and caters to a diverse clientele of business and leisure travelers, tour groups, event attendees, airline crews, wedding parties, sports teams etc. The rooms are fine...spacious and comfortable, with all usual amenities expected from a luxury hotel (no premium toiletries though). However, the carpeting looks dated, and the corridors lack proper ventilation, or so it seems...since it smells of food, alcohol, air freshener, and other odd odors during different times of the day.   One area where I've found the hotel to be consistently lacking is…Read more"

I have been here many times but not since covid so wasn't sure what to expect but needn't have worried. From start to finish we were well looked after by Manashi on the Club floor. The room was great and so were the Club business facilities.  The Clubroom evening  food was always a nice addition but under Chef Farid it really excels with flavours hitting European tastes exactly.  Nice to see Gunal's smiling face again making us welcome in the Club. Breakfast in the Club seems to have been pared back though - really missed the dosa's I used to have.  The hotel pool and gym are a very welcome addition and well maintained.  Overall fantastic stay thanks everyone. Read more

"I am staying at Hotel Grant Hyatt Mumbai with my family.  The behavior of room dining staff Mr. Suraj ji was very friendly and helpful.  People of similar nature are required in the hotel business.  My best wishes to Suraj and all his associates and staff.  I would like God to progress him and make him more highly placed.  It is because of people having such a spirit of cooperation that the hotel establishes a good relationship with its customers.  People come to the hotel after seeing its infrastructure but more people stay in the hotel and like it because of the behavior of the hotel staff.  Similarly, the room dining staff is also Suraj, due to whose behavior we have stayed in this hotel with our family before and are still staying and will stay in the future and encourage…Read more"

"Being a member of the Hyatt fidelity programme, I booked and paid a king bed room in a high rise floor in June 2023 for accommodation starting on the 2nd of November. Upon check in we were given a worn out, dirty room with no toiletries, nor bath robe in the Residence. According to the front desk this was an “upgrade”. The following day we were moved to a first floor room in the hotel on top of one of the main halls where a very noisy disco was taking place! According to the hotel this was a second “upgrading”.  The hotel clearly cheated on us and no compensation was offered.  My trust in the Grand Hyatt standards is badly shaken!Read more"

"Let’s start with the check in and the attitude of Priyanka, a bit condescending would be an understatement, she seems like she was doing us a favour letting us stay at the not so grand Hyatt .   Two people two different rooms checking in at the same time, my friend and I,  both ask her in plain English are these the renovated rooms we are getting, and they reply yes they are. Get to the rooms they are stuck in the stone ages, carpets are stained just an absolute filth of a room, definitely not what you expect from a grand Hyatt. Rest of the hotel and the lounge is fine, the attitude of the staff is the problem, like at breakfast when you ask someone for something which is not already laid out they are not too pleased, maybe they don’t like the exercise of going downstairs to get…Read more"

"Over 500 rooms hotel with 3 check-in/out counters. Have always seen a queue, even at 23:00 in the night. I don’t generally take out time to write reviews but I had to this time.  While checkout this time, there was a long queue so I went up to the front desk staff asking to open the 3rd counter as only 2 were operating and was rudely asked to join back the queue. They take a big block on the card on top of total stay amount during check-in but don’t use that either for keydrop type service or fast checkout. (They will tell you it’s not possible legally) - then don’t block big amounts on the card.   Also, on Tuesday night during my last stay, there was some party going in the hotel. Loud thumping music was audible even in my room on the 2nd floor. I called the front desk to be…Read more"

"Grand Hyatt at Vakola, Kalina, Santacruz, Mumbai (probably the address can never get completed the way India writes addresses!!) is my favourite place in Mumbai since I stopped going to the 5th floor of the old Taj Mahal Palace in Colaba or The Oberoi at the Nariman Point. Earthy colours, no unnecessary trinkets, just plain simple elegance makes arguably the largest hotel in india worth every moment.. Read more"

"Very Disgusting Experience!!!  Came to Grand Hayatt for a overnight stay with family, Room Services were very slow, it took 45mins to get the Tea, Morning Breakfast at Ciliny - Very dissatisfied- No Salt in most of the dishes. For lunch we planned to have Pizza, which took us more than 1 hr to get the pizza, Billing took another 45mins... Above all we had a voucher for cake and had placed the order the previous night to celebrate our son's success and they promised to give the cake  by 1230pm. Till 345pm there was no cake given, inspite of waiting for so long we could not get our cake as it was not ready... We just left disheartened, after our worst experience today...   Read more"

"Revisited the hotel recently again and oh boy have they changed, for the worse. Mud water in the shower to 15 days old water in the rooms( they have packing dates on them) to stained carpets and un-functional ACs in a room.  But nothing beats the arrogance and rudeness of the ""DM"" Faraz Qureshi. Please deal or speak with him only if you would like to ruin your day/ night. And definitely don't expect any help here. He would rather have u find another hotel, trust me.  Time has ruined great(Grand) things too, Such a shame.Read more"

"Highly enjoyable and peaceful stay. That is how I can sum up my stay . My stay with my family was not that long. We stayed here for 2 nights but I was blown away by the hospitality and the politeness of the staff. Probably the best I have interacted with. My daughter had become friends with a staff member (her name was kenei ) . Absolutely sweet of her to send up a delicious chocolate cake for her  and that too twice. At the time of checkout when the staff came to know about this ,they gave some pancakes in a dish decorated with rose petals and all. It had an icing of a choc sauce which said ""come back soon"" . Some of the staff members also took a photograph of us on the breakfast table. Sometimes such gestures touch you more than any amenities or any other luxury.  The…Read more"

"My advice to anyone staying at this hotel is to check your credit card statement after you have checked out. The hotel debited my accommodation and the pre-authorisation amount from my card. It has been one month and the money is still not returned. Countless emails sent, heartfelt apologies and commitments have been received but no INR. Firstly it’s 7-10 days to return the funds, now it’s 10-15 days. I’ve escalated within the Hyatt community but have had no response. I’ve spent more time on trying to resolve this issue than I spent in India on the trip. What a joke.Read more"

The hotel needs a complete makeover including their people. The room allocated had icy cold Breeze from the vent despite switching the AC off. Room changed after 10 hours when I showed up at the front office myself. Duty manager too busy to respond to my calls. Changed room had a musty smell. Changed again. It has a balcony but a dirty one. The WC flush didn't work. Which maintenance fixed thankfully.  Breakfast great. That's why the 2 stars. So the kitchens working well but ops is in bad shape.Read more

The hotel as the name suggest is grand in every sense. The rooms are huge but a little dated and need some refurbishment.  The check in as well as check out process was a little time consuming as there were only few desks were functional.  The breakfast buffet spread was huge with a wide variety of options and cuisines.  The hotel is close to BKC and hence a good option for those wanting to stay inbetween the office and the airport.  Hotel has a good fitness centre as well as steam and sauna.Read more

"I checked out at the front desk. I wanted to get a hard copy of the invoice but the staff refused to give it to me. He then said they would email me instead. This was fine but at the end they DID NOT email me at all. After I was back to HK, I emailed the hotel twice to request the soft copy. Totally being ignored with no replies. Then I called them up directly but they still failed to fulfill my simple request. So disappointed with this hotel. The service really sucks.Read more"

"Not my first time but probably my last at this Hyatt  property. As a Globalist, I was neither greeted as one nor were my preferences noted ahead of arrival. The hotel had several conferences going on and the staff seemed overwhelmed - if they cannot handle the business, they should not have it. The management of this property needs a lesson or two on guest services.Read more"

"Firstly, in case of any events, hotel needs to plan how to handle rush. Check-in service was pathetic. I had to wait an hour to just check-in to my room. I requested for a smoking room, but again to no help, it was unavailable. Reason given since there is event in hotel, most of the rooms are booked. I checked with the hotel before checking in for my request. I came for a luxurious and relaxed stay as it was my birthday, I was given a room that was at the far end of the hotel, so even to come down to lobby, I literally had to walk for around 10-15 mins. It was birthday, i requested to arrange a cake, nobody even contacted back on my request, rather than providing anything complementary and make me feel special, I had to call 2-3 times for a cake, and that too wasn't taken care…Read more"

"Pleasant stay at the hotel.. The property is in a reasonably good location, making it easier to get around Mumbai. There are some busy junctions just around the hotel though, that make it a little difficult to move in or out at rush hours.  Liked the food overall at the hotel. Breakfast spread has sufficient variety including vegetarian options. Breakfast place usually stays quite busy, better to go earlier than later.  Food at their Italian restaurant 'Celini' is great. I usually do not like Italian, however chose Celini as my friend was craving for Italian. Was pleasantly surpised by the flavourful dishes.  Also suggest to book the Club room at the hotel, which allows access to the 'Club' area where either you or your guest can have some light snacks and drinks, which i felt…Read more"

"To whom it may concern and to all potential guests considering a stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Residences:  I recently had the misfortune of staying at this property and I must express my profound disappointment. I am a Platinum member of the Hyatt Dining Club, a status that promises several privileges and benefits. Unfortunately, the treatment I received was anything but privileged.  To start, the booking process for my ""One Plus One"" night stay, a benefit of my membership, was a nightmare. I had to engage with the Hyatt Dining Club's customer service multiple times just to secure a confirmation. Why offer such benefits if availing them is going to be this troublesome?  Further, I required an additional room on the 2nd of September. Despite the property having vacant rooms,…Read more"

"Went to Grand Hyatt Fifty Five East Restaurant for the Onam Sadhya. The meal cost INR 3700 pp. There were 30 dishes by chef Marina who walked around the table to greet everyone and check if we liked the food.  The food was delicious, ambience amazing. I was seated in Table no 15. I found a downside that the arrangement while beautiful, lacked a bit of organization. Banana leaf was already spread out with few ingredients, the others took some time coming in. When one course was served, we had to wait for next for e.g. vegetables were served, but rice took 10 more minutes to serve and the food got cold. We did not receive one set of vegetables in the first round, I saw it going through other tables.  We had to ask for 2nd helping of rice twice before we got it.The banana kept on…Read more"

Had a fantastic experience at Celini. They serve authentic italian food which was of highest quality. The ambience is wonderful and service of the highest class. The staff was courteous and professional. Saurabh made it very special for us and helped us customize some of the dishes to match our tastes and requirement. Pankaj and Taalim were very gracious and ensured we were comfortable and well taken care of. They also served us complementary desserts which was the icing on the cake as we had visited for a special occasion. Highly recommended!!Read more

"It's the worst experience I have had in a hotel since as long as I can remember. The staff is rude and disrespectful and full of themselves. No sense of Hospitality. Ruined my birthday celebration. The duty manager of the prestigious Grand Hyatt of Mumbai has threatened me and told me that his security might have to get physical if I take my friends upstairs. These are friends who have come to wish me at 11pm an hour before my birthday. I wasn't allowed to pay a fee for extra guests. I wasn't allowed to book a whole separate room for my guests. Apparently, even if I book a different room, I can't take those guests into the biggest suite that I had booked for my birthday. No benefits of booking the largest suite. No benefits of being a gold member of the Hyatt Dining club. Do not…Read more"

"We had an exceptional stay at the Hyatt. We were greeted with kind, efficient, and sophisticated service at every step of the way. It is the spirit of the people who work here that creates such a special experience.   Chirag helped us with room service on a couple occasions. He was pleasant and professional in every way.   Sarswati greeted us with a smile at every breakfast. We enjoyed hearing about her recommendations for our time in Mumbai. She listened thoroughly to our interests and questions, and generously offered tips and information for our stay.  Agnel was frequently our server at breakfast. He remembered our coffee (and soy milk!) requests, and began to anticipate our orders at breakfast time. We was warm, genuine, and wonderful in every way.   Chef Rakesh's food was…Read more"

"You pay fir hospitality not for the room.  That is what my experience had been in 50 years.  Excellent young staff,  very courteous,  trained for hospitality.  Was on vacation.  And I am very picky. Room was Excellent.  Glad that this was the first stop  Breakfast is the best I have eaten in years in India. Best bakery (very tough to find good breads), very vast spread.  Saraswati, Rajesh, Sahil, Indra took care of us so well. I thought Prabhadevi vadapav is the best. They even beat that.   Would give 5+ star for choice stay for family vacations Read more"

"We stayed at Grand Hyatt Mumbai for a week and really enjoyed our stay here. Coming across different country (Indonesia), so we don’t expect that we will like the foods, but turns out we did🥰🥰 Here they offer plenty of different foods, not only Indian cuisine but also some Western cuisine. The Indian cuisine is the one that we like, ranging from very subtle herbs and lots of herbs type of food - thanks to Chef Sandeep! Our favorites are Filtered Coffee and Dosa Cheese & Masala❤️❤️❤️ I wish I can bring it back to our country. The warm hospitality, excellent service, and friendly staffs are also one of the things that I will miss. Love how everyone welcomes us, esp. Veeneth, Abhedh, Prateek, Chef Sadeep, Suchita, and Sarswati! Highly recommended to book your stay here👍👍Read more"

"We stayed at the property for 25 odd days due to medical reasons we needed an apartment due to the duration. Lets just say it is bare basic nothing what you are paying for not worth the money at all very poorly maintained nails coming out of chairs, stained carpet, seepage in the ceiling. I don’t suggest staying here as prices are at par you can get somewhere better to stay. The staff is very poorly trained and the caliber of the staff is very low due to lack of pay and training it seems, they don’t care for their customers they are ignorant despite staying at the hotel for nearly 4 weeks we weren’t able to connect with the duty manager nor the gm as it seems they were busy for 25days straight with what god only knows. Breakfast variety is decent but service is horrible…Read more"

"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for about 20 days for work. I stayed first in a King size room on the first floor (Club floor) which was very spacious, street-facing, and nice. But due to the renovation starting, was asked to move to the 4th floor, Queen room facing the courtyard with a balcony. The balcony was nice to have, but due to the monsoon, couldn't sit out. And at times, could hear other guests on their balcony talking from my room. Switched to a twin room again on the fourth floor, street facing which was also good. I would have breakfast and dinner every day at Fifty-five East and got to know many of the staff. They were always friendly, attentive, and accommodating, often bringing my jasmine tea to my table #40 without asking for it. It was a multi-cuisine restaurant…Read more"

"I booked this hotel for a one night stay and I wish I had booked somewhere else instead. The stay started off well, with a very nicely organized airport pickup. Hotel location is close to the airport and the Western suburbs. Check in however took a long time with one guest discussing his room preferences for 10 minutes and no one intervening to move things along till a Manager stepped in. My bag however did not arrive at the room till I reminded the front desk about it. Room by itself was nice and nothing to complain about. In room dining order took quite some time to arrive and after a follow up. No ETA given during the ordering process. Even though I had breakfast included, I was checking out early for a flight and did not get a chance to try it. Sometimes Hotels ask if they…Read more"

"We as a family took a short trip to Mumbai this monsoon season & my staycation at Grand Hyatt Mumbai was just awesome.Woke up to having a wide spread of breakfast.There were different live counters, live stations serving yummy food. I started my morning by sipping on some fresh watermelon juice. Fruits were fresh & juicy be it mangoes,kiwi,pineapple,guava & many to choose from.Being from Pune I first hogged on my favourite food Misal Pav. A special mention about 'Bircher Museli',I absolutely loved it! I also enjoyed the mini uttapams,dhoklas,khandvi, tomato upma,vermicelli upma,filter coffee,hot served parathas & I loved the way the Dosa was presented on banana leaf along with the chutneys & sambar. Dosas were crisp & nice I liked the cheese one more.Hospitality is great, the…Read more"

"It was exceptional stay and most of service was amazing and went up and beyond specially Mr. Faraz at check in and Mr.Sagar and his conceirge team and whole team in evening lounge was exceptional. Housekeeping was attentive and help with everything. But the problems start when you try calling to room service or any service from in house phones and it takes forever to connect sometimes more than 5min which is unacceptable and never seen on other properties. Plus I have taken in house bar and dining services and sometimes forgot to give world of Hyatt number and was surprised to know I can't add it next day ( even airline let you add later in case you forget , so sure Hyatt also have to add it ) . But beyond this two things the experience was amazing and very comfortable.Read more"

Don’t EVER book the apartments. For the price the only positive is the area footage. Rest is all downhill from there. Access to the rooms are stinky hallways. Room carpets are filthy. Sinks in the bathroom don’t drain. Sparsely furnished. No plug points near the bed. No answer to housekeeping or any such service post 12:00 am. Gives me a feeling I’m in some seedy motel. Can’t believe this is Grand Hyatt.Read more

"While vacationing in Mumbai we chose the Grand Hyatt a second time around because of the wonderful experience we had during our first stay years before. Once again, the staff at the Grand Hyatt made us feel at home. We were initially not happy with the room we got at check in. On voicing our displeasure, the manager on duty offered us an upgrade for the remainder of our stay and he and the rest of the front desk staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and satisfied. As part of the room package, the hotel offers a sumptuous breakfast with engaging staff who go above and beyond to make your daily breakfast experience memorable.  Needless to say, we will definitely choose the Grand Hyatt for our future Mumbai vacations. Read more"

This place welcomes you with rudeness. They took 30 minutes to handover room key. While I was asking why it is taking so much time staff just didn’t reply anything logical and avoided eye contact. Also even if they have contract of breakfast with XYZ company which booked my hotel they refuse breakfast saying they have brunch today and I cannot avail it. OYO is better than Grand Hyatt Mumbai avoid it at all cost.Read more

"I stayed multiple times in last few weeks in Grand Hyatt Mumbai and am amazed how they have been delivering consistent experiences for so many years .  It’s also amazing to see so many old timer staff like Daddy who benevolently watches the team perform or Ms Rana in the breakfast time , a bundle of energy ..  Similarly Manashi Borah in Grand Club was amazing in making sure my stay was comfortable   This is probably the best Hyatt in delivering the soft productRead more"

"Rude and pathetic Room Service staff behaviour at Grand Hyatt Mumbai. Here is my experience. 1. Called Room Service ordered for “ 1 Veg Pizza, 1 Crispy French Fries, 1 Coke, Extra Mayonnaise and Extra Ketchup” 2. Ms. Manjushree repeats the order verbatim.  3. Order gets delivered without the mayonnaise.  4. Call back Room Service and politely speak with Ms. Manjushree again to inform her of the request for the “missing” mayonnaise from the food delivered. 5. But now I make the COLOSSAL MISTAKE of requesting Ms. Manjushree to add an additional Mustard sauce along the “undelivered” mayonnaise as requested earlier. 6. Ms. Manjushree replies “BUT SIR YOU ONLY ORDERED FOR THE MAYONNAISE NOT MUSTARD”  Moral of the story. You can only place an order “once” at Grand Hyatt Mumbai. Any…Read more"

Disappointed with the hotel. Very Old Rooms. Restaurants overpriced. Executive lounge was serving terrible low quality wines that I thought were watered down.

"We were in Mumbai for a 2 nights, thick in the middle of monsoons and I'm glad we choose to stay in Grand Hyatt Mumbai Hotel & Residences. The hotel was remarkable, offering ample space and serving delicious food. The staff members were exceptional, attending to every detail and request with excellence. From the moment we checked in until our departure, we felt incredibly well taken care of. Our interactions with Vijaylaxmi (Manager- Guest relations) were particularly enjoyable, and our little daughter remains enchanted, fondly remembering the kind lady from Mumbai. Our overall trip became a memorable one, thanks to the outstanding team at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai.Read more"

"Overall: An excellent hotel which is best for business travellers in Mumbai since it is in the vicinity of the Bandra Kurla Complex. In addition, it is relatively close to Mumbai's international airport.   The road is quiet by Indian standards and is well kept. The entrance is clean and vast with brilliant adjacent gardens.   The welcome did fall short of expectations at a five star hotel in India. There was very little of a ""swagat"". Very few members of staff opened the door, no sense of a welcome or namaste on some occasions. It could be improved with a welcoming drink too which would make the welcome in keeping with other hotels of its league.   The reception staff was excellent, especially at the concierge desk. The hotel did promptly take our baggage to our room.   The room…Read more"

"I am a Marriot Bonvoy Titanium Ambassador Level (Life Platinum) and hardly stay at Hyatt properties; however as we needed a long term stay in Mumbai for my family and I, my company booked us for a month (Jun/Jul 2023) at the GH Residences and we have had terrible experience all along.  - We booked as a family of 4 and upon arrival the dining table only had 2 chairs. The kitchen that is supposed to be fully equipped for long term stay only had 4 plates, 3 folks, 3 knives and 3 spoon. There was hardly any serving cutlery, 2-3 pot/pans and no serving bowls, bottle openers. After multiple requests over few days we were able to request some of the above but it required multiple asks - For breakfast, we were directed to the spill over dining room for first 2 days and it was under…Read more"

"Stayed in June 2 days 1 night as part of business trip. Overall stay was ok, but there were glaring issues which I wouldn’t have faced in a good hotel.  1. At check in they take the luggage at the gate as there are stairs involved and they transfer that to the room after checkin. I had a meeting starting in 45 mins after check in, I was still following up for my luggage till 30 mins after .. finally they said they would make sure it’s in my room and I can go ahead with lunch in the last 15 mins.  2. Nobody picked up my phone during the above waiting period , not the concierge or room service for food.  3. I had to go down to the restaurant for lunch. I asked 5 people, everyone told me the name of a restaurant to grab lunch, but when I reached the buffet only starts 45 mins later…Read more"

"The building is beautiful and the artwork is breathtaking. However, the service is lacking and I was not impressed. When I first got to the hotel, there was no information on the TV or in paper form about the hotel so I had no idea about room service, restaurants, pool, etc.   When I went to the front desk to inquire about having the information, they just gave me a brief verbal description about things.  At this point it was about 2:30 and I had not eaten lunch so they told me the buffet restaurant was available and confirmed it was open all day. When I arrived 15 minutes later to eat, they advised me that the buffet was closing in 15 minutes and would re-open in the evening and discouraged me from eating there.  Trying to order room service was another disappointment. Having…Read more"

"The room itself was comfortable and the bath facilities were nice, but there were quite a few hiccups.  I had booked a room with a patio and I was given one, but there was no patio furniture.  When I asked about same, they brought one chair.  When I asked for a second chair (with two people staying), they brought one.  Then I had to also ask for a table.    Next, the phone stopped working in the room.  They were able to send someone to fix this and he was quick and effective.    But the biggest problem I had was with laundry.  I arrived with no clean clothes at about 2:30pm.  I called the front desk and asked about laundry turn-around time and was told 10-12 hours.  This was no problem, so I called to have immediately laundry pick-up and handed over some clothes.  The prices…Read more"

"When we checked in, I found the frontline staff to be really rude. Whenever you call they never ever pick up the phone or never call back. I had to go to the reception and tell them about the problems. The bathroom was clogged, can you all imagine? We are talking about a suite here. Food in Cellini was really good and even the service. My disappointment was majorly with the front desk and the lousy breakfast. Read more"

"A Club Members review. 1. Bisleri water was replaced with glass bottles. Now water tastes bad + someone's  broken bottle stuck to my slipper last week OUCH!  2. jacuzzi broke 2 weeks ago and they say it will take 2 more weeks. Thats too long !   3. 75k annual pool membership is now 120k as of Feb 2023. THAT MEANS A 160% price increase Since LAST YEAR.   Pricing goes up, everywhere, but this 160% hike is unreasonable in a 12 month window.  4. No new amenities complement this price increase.   I say this Club is a favorite!   The staff is diligent, promt, the pool services clean and not too chlorinated, the sauna remains hot finally ( now that the magnetic enclosure was fixed in march.)  PLEASE do not slip into decline CLUB OASIS!    Offer bisleri again ... with better annual…Read more"

One of the most unprofessional duty managers I have encountered. Mukhtar should not be allowed to interact with guest. He has a major attitude problem. We asked for a larger room and they said they were giving us one on check in. When I go up to the room I realise it’s the regular standard room. Don’t tell a guest you’re giving them a larger room and try to pass of a regular room as a larger room. Be honest. When the matter reached mukhtar he argues by saying “how do you know if it’s a regular room”?  When I ask to see another room that is the regular size as they claim he refuses. Because the lie is now caught. Terrible experience.Read more

"Absolutely worst in hospitality and really stubborn and rude staff. I was there for ny company provided stay. While checking in, since i had 2 suitcases, i requested for a room with some space for storing luggage. I was bluntly told by the duty manager to keep the luggage on the floor as all rooms have similar luggage storage space. To make the matters worse, for ordering a takeaway breakfast, i requested for an omelette made of 4 eggs. Shockingly, the IRD staff refused to give me more than 2 eggs citing company contract. Absolutely let down by this kind of poor conduct and stubborn behaviour by the hotel staff. Read more"

Using her massage skills by clever use of oil, fingers, hands and relieving the fatigued body with deep tissue massage unknotting the pressure points maintaining the tempo like a melodious music. A hour of massage felt like a real symphony even in absence of music. Club Oasis spa and the masseuse is a wonderful experience. Read more"
